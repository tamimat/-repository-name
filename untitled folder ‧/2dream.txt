///the first dream i remember from my very early childhood.
Me and my elder brother are tied up by our mom. The rope she has used is intertwined with snakes. I try to untangle us. My brother is scared and says "beware of the snakes". I manage to untangle us. I grab his hand. Then my mom opens the door and we get scared and we run away. There is a hole in front of us. We run and fall in that hole. I wake up and feel as if I was really hovering over the bed and fell down when I woke up.

I saw the üïã and the muslims where shepherded away from it by people holding the flag of the united nations. I was standing there and trying to walk against the stream towards the üïã. As this was getting difficult I tried to climb the fence that was build on our left and right to make it easier to guide the people away from the üïã.

I am having dinner with the Lex team. Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy are sitting at the table with me. I am telling Yi the story of Zappos. At some point, I lean over the table and get very close to Jeff to apologize. He says, "Yeah, it happens, we're used to it from playing on the iPad." Then I continue telling the story and mention how Tony Hsieh successfully refocused the company that had its ups and downs. They had done something with the packaging. Then I ask Jeff, "Who is the VP of Packaging?" Jeff and Andy look at each other and have no answer. I continue with the story. Later, we stand up, and Jeff tells me, "I didn't want to call you out, but something something seven years ago when we met." Then he shows me a picture on the wall in black and white where his (Asian) daughter can be seen wearing a fake beard. Then he laughs. We leave together. And I see an overturned broken vase üè∫. I tell Jeff, "Wait, let me clean it up so the children don't get hurt." Jeff takes a photo of it too. I turn around and see Jumana playing with the vase. I take the shards out of her hand. After that, I see Jeff carrying Jumana on one of his shoulders and moving forward. Then the dream ends.

I am standing in a photo and will soon get married. My mother has arranged a bride for me who is very small. She is dressed in a costume that somewhat resembles Minnie Mouse. When I find out that she is only six years old, I call off the wedding. Then I take the microphone and start a speech. I tell how wrong the whole thing is and that the community seems to find it acceptable. Outside, there is a large mountain/rock. At the foot of the mountain, people are dumping their garbage. Then I ask the people: What is this mountain called? "Dumpster Mountain." I tell them how this wonderful landscape is spoiled by this garbage dump. And all because people are using an outdated system. This proud and beautiful mountain is called Trash Mountain because of this small garbage dump. What has it done to deserve that? What have the surrounding rocks done to deserve it? There are better methods today to dispose of waste. And it is the same with our religion. Religion is being marred by old, archaic rituals. Rituals that are outdated and no longer fit our time. Then I woke up.

Certainly! In this dream, the act of getting married represents a significant life event or commitment. It can symbolize a transition, partnership, or a merging of different aspects of your life. However, the presence of a small bride dressed as Minnie Mouse introduces a sense of unease or discomfort. This may suggest feelings of immaturity, inappropriateness, or a lack of alignment with your expectations or values.

By breaking off the wedding upon discovering the bride's young age, you assert your own boundaries and refuse to participate in a situation that goes against your principles. This decision reflects a sense of moral integrity and a willingness to challenge societal norms or expectations that may be harmful or inappropriate.

The subsequent speech you deliver represents a desire to voice your beliefs and challenge the status quo. By addressing the community and questioning their acceptance of the situation, you express a need for change and highlight the discrepancy between the beauty and dignity of the mountain and the presence of a garbage dump at its base.

The metaphor of the garbage dump signifies outdated systems, practices, or beliefs that are tarnishing or polluting an otherwise pristine and noble aspect of life. It could symbolize traditions, rituals, or ideologies that no longer serve a purpose or align with your personal values. Your critique of these archaic rituals within religion suggests a longing for a more meaningful and authentic spiritual experience, one that reflects the present time and resonates with your inner self.

Overall, this dream indicates a strong sense of personal integrity, a willingness to challenge societal norms, and a desire for personal growth and a more fulfilling life path. It suggests that you are questioning established beliefs, seeking change, and yearning for deeper connections and authenticity in various aspects of your life.
