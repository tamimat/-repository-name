2 dream

First dream from my very early childhood.
Me and my elder brother are tried up by our mom. The rope she has used is intertwined with snakes. I try to untangle us. My brother is scared and says "Beware of the snakes". I manage to untangle us. I grab his hand. Then my mom opens the door and we get scared and we run away. There is a hole in front of us. We run and fall in that hole. I wake up and feel as if I was really hovering over the bed and fell down when I woke up.

A dream in 2009
I saw the Kaaba and the muslims where shepherded away from it by people holding the flag of the united nations. I was standnig there and trying to walk against the stream towards the Kaaba. As this was getting difficult I tried to climb the fence that was build on our left and right to make it easier to guide the people away from the kaaba.
