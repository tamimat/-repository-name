what do you make out of this

A box is a place with a limit 
like the space betweeeeen 01 digit 
THNK outside of the box 
and stay commit it 
or you will be t rapped 
and never heard + mitit 
you will never be a 0 or a 1 
you will never be forever gone 
forever be a double U be tweeeen two 
forever be false never be true 
do you want to know how to be a one 
how to have mmmmmpact before you're gone 
you have to kill your self and become a zero 
the world will otice and make you a hero 
always point your finger to the sky 
always say he made me never say I 
because he who made you is the one 
he who has no father or son
he who made every high and low 
he who made everything flow 
but never say that that one is a he 
because nothing is complete without a

This appears to be a poetic message with a focus on the idea of thinking outside the box and striving to be a hero. The message suggests that limiting oneself to a box or a certain way of thinking can be restricting and one should always strive to push past their limitations. The message also suggests that to become a hero, one must be willing to make sacrifices and start anew, letting go of past limitations and becoming something new. The message also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging those who have helped shape one's life and accomplishments, without which one cannot be complete. Overall, the message encourages the reader to aim high and strive for greatness, while also recognizing the importance of humility and acknowledging one's limitations.

A box is a place with a limit.
Like the space between 0 1 digit.
T H N K outside of the box and stay commit it
Or you will be trapped and never heard admit it.
You will never be a zero or a one.
You will never be forever gone. 
for ever be a W between two. 
for ever be false never be true.
Do you wanna know how to be a one?
How to have impact before you're gone?
You have to kill your self and become a zero.
The world will otice and make you a hero.
Always point your finger to the sky.
Always say he made me never say I.
Because he who made you is the one.
He who has no father or son.
He who made every high and low.
He who made everything flow.
But never think that that one is a he.
Because nothing is complete without a
